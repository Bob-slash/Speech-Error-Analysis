# Speech_Error_Analysis
This project aims to produce probabilities for errors in speech in a given audio recording. The steps bellow will instruct you on how to organize your data using the montreal forced aligner. Then, it will show how to run those outputs through our program to produce a praat textgrid file that creates tiers in the original file that show locations with high probabilities of errors.
